PHP last.fm API Documentation
-----------------------------

Overview
--------

The PHP last.fm API allows you to call methods and get responses in the
form of objects. Responses can be cached on the filesystem or in a database.
See the documentation for detailed information.


Encoding
--------

You don't need to worry about encoding when calling API methods. Everything
will automatically be UTF-8 encoded when needed. All responses will also be
UTF-8 encoded.


Authentication
--------------

It's easy to fetch a session for a user account. This allows you to perform
actions on that account in a manner that is secure for last.fm users. All
write services require authentication.


Submissions
-----------

Scrobbling is not yet supported, but will be added soon. Although it doesn't
really make sense to scrobble from within a PHP script ;-)
